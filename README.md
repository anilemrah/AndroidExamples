# AndroidExamples
This file contains examples of Android applications that I was working on to learn how to create awasome applications.
Example 1 - Contains one button and I have learned how to use relative layout and how to convert dpi to pixel.
Example 2 - Contains first event listener example which manipultes the text when you click button.
